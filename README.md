# react-kanban-app
This app draws inspiration from project management collaboration apps like Trello and Jira. It features the tasks on schedule, those that are being done, and those which have been accomplished. 
It implements a drag-and-drop feature, whereby acrds are dragged from one board to another. This app is mostly enjoyable on computers and tablets.
